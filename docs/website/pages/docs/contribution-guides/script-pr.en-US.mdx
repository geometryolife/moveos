# pr.sh script introduction

When contributing code to Rooch, we need to do some checking.

In order to avoid introducing some bugs every time we submit the code, we provide the `scripts/pr.sh` script, which can help us perform CI checks locally when submitting a PR (pull request) to Rooch.

For example, when we contribute a example to `examples`, after using `rooch move new` to initialize the project, in addition to replacing the project address of the `Move.toml` file with `_` wildcards, we also need to add a `[dev-addresses]` table and fill in a field for unit testing. address.

The `[dev-addresses]` table not added to `examples/quick_start_counter/Move.toml`:

```shell
BUILDING quick_start_counter
Success
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.53s
     Running `target/debug/rooch move test -p examples/quick_start_counter`
thread 'main' panicked at 'resolve package dep failed: Unresolved addresses found: [
Named address 'quick_start_counter' in package 'quick_start_counter'
]
To fix this, add an entry for each unresolved address to the [addresses] section of examples/quick_start_counter/Move.toml: e.g.,
[addresses]
Std = "0x1"
Alternatively, you can also define [dev-addresses] and call with the -d flag', crates/rooch/src/commands/move_cli/commands/unit_test.rs:64:14
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
Error: Process completed with exit code 101.
```

## Use

Switch to the root directory of the Rooch project and run the following command:

```shell
./scripts/pr.sh -e
```

During the process of running the CI check, if a corresponding error occurs, it will be automatically interrupted. Make corresponding modifications to the code to be submitted based on the modification suggestions provided at the check point, and run again.

Until all checks pass, submit your code to Rooch's remote repository.
